What I Learner from this Project.

1) write core css to make animations for buttons, 
  -> filters (blur)
  -> transform translate rotate
  -> @keyframes for making animations
  -> using animation properties on div like name, duration, direction, timing function, iteration count
  -> line height
  -> letter spacing
  -> made utmost use of vw and vh to make it dynamic
2) concept of position attribute
  -> relative
  -> absolute
  -> fixed
3) Revisited the concepts of Core js
  -> document.querySelector
  -> var
  -> .foreach
  -> user def functions
3) installed locomotive js
  -> for smooth scrolling
4) Used Slider JS
  -> to create a slider animation on page3
